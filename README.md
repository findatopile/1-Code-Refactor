Homework 1: Code Refactor

This project is on refactoring an existing webpage to make it meet accessibility standards by using semantic elements, ensuring that elements follow a logical flow and structure, implementing alt attributes and using an appropriate title.

The code has also been cleaned up and checked by making sure that all links are functioning, css styles and elements are consolidated in an organised manner and unnecessary attributes are removed.
